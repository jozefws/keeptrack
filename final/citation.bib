	abstract     = {In this paper we present an augmented reality (AR) application based on the QR Code. The system can extract the information embedded in a QR Code and show the information in an extended 3D form with the QR Code being the traditional AR marker. Traditional AR systems often use a particularly designed pattern (the marker) to recover the 3D scene structure and identify the object to be displayed on the scene. In these systems, the marker is used only for tracking and identification. They do not convey any other information. Consequently, the applications of these systems are limited and often a registration procedure is required for a new marker.QR Code has the advantage of large information capacity and is similar to an AR marker in appearance. Thus, more interesting and useful applications can be developed by combining the QR Code with the traditional AR system. In this paper, we combine these two techniques to develop a product demo system. A QR Code is pasted on the package of a product and then a 3D virtual object is displayed on the QR Code. This system allows the customer to visualize the product via a more direct and interactive way. Our system demonstrates the success of using QR Code as the AR marker to a particular application and we believe it can bring more convenient to our life in the future.},
